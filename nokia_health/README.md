## Requirements

This plugin requires lib nokia. You can install this lib with: 

```bash
sudo pip3 install nokia --upgrade
```

You have to go through the registration and oauth process on https://developer.health.nokia.com/api.
In the end, after step 4, you see the access token and the access token secret in the input fields and the user id in the data right to it.

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml
```yaml
nokia_health:
    class_name: NokiaHealth
    class_path: plugins.nokia_health
    consumer_key: <your_consumer_key>
    consumer_secret: <your_consumer_secret>
    access_token: <your_access_token>
    access_token_secret: <your_access_token_secret>
    user_id: <your_userid>
    instance: nokia_health
```

### items.yaml

Please be aware that there are dependencies for the values. E.g. the body measurement index will only be calculated if a
height exists. From what i saw so far is, that the height is transmitted only one time, the first time the scale 
communicates with the Nokia servers. In case you miss it, set the item value manually!

```yaml
body:

    weight:
        type: num
        visu_acl: ro
        nh_type@nokia_health: weight

    height:

        visu_acl: ro
        nh_type@nokia_health: height
